# Use sed to find and replace the line.
# - `s/pattern/replacement/` is the substitution command.
# - `^\([[:space:]]*\)`: Matches and captures any whitespace characters (the indentation) at the beginning of the line.
# - `\1`: In the replacement string, this pastes the captured indentation back.
# - `-i.bak`: This option edits the file in-place and creates a backup of the original file with a .bak extension.

# --- Confirmation ---
# Check if the substitution was successful by seeing if the file changed.
# If `sed` made a change, the original and backup will be different.
